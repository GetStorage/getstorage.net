<p><strong>The Services</strong></p>

    interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Services. The
    Services includes all aspects of MediaFire, including but not limited to, all products, software and

    symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>MediaFire Accounts</strong></p>

    account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and are
    responsible for all activities that occur utilizing your information. Although MediaFire will not be liable
    for any losses you might suffer, you may be liable for the losses of MediaFire or others</p>

<p><strong>MediaFire Premium Accounts Terms and Conditions</strong></p>

    THE INITIAL 12 MONTHS ONLY AND WILL BEGIN BILLING MONTHLY STARTING THE 13TH MONTH AFTER SIGNUP, REQUIRING
    PERIODIC PAYMENTS, MONTHLY OR ANNUALLY, WITH RECURRING CREDIT CARD CHARGES OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD SELECTED
    BY YOU, UNLESS TERMINATED OR CANCELLED BY YOU OR MEDIAFIRE AS PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENT. You agree to pay
    all account charges and any applicable taxes and other fees that accrue in relation to your use of the
    Services. A more detailed description of premium services and the features can be found on the
    <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/upgrade/" target="_blank">Product Matrix</a> page.</p>

<p>You may cancel a subscription at any time through your My Account page. Your account will remain active for
    the remainder of the term for which you have previously paid after which it will revert to a standard free
    account and be subject to the restrictions of a free account. MediaFire may, without compensation or
    proration, cancel your subscription in the event of nonpayment or dispute of payment or if you violate any
    terms or conditions of the Agreement.</p>

<p>Premium services offer "Rollover Bandwidth". Unused bandwidth in each billing period will become available in
    subsequent billing periods, without time limitations for usage. You will be billed immediately for the new
    plan and any unused bandwidth from your previous plan will be Rolled over into your new plan.
    Additional increments of bandwidth may be purchased for immediate use, which qualifies as Rollover
    Bandwidth. This one time purchase is not a reoccurring charge and will not affect the pricing of your
    subscription service. You may view your billing history from your My Account page.</p>

<p>Bandwidth in a premium account is consumed by anyone, including you, who download your file(s). From your My
    Account page, you may view stats about your bandwidth usage, which take several hours to process from the
    moment of access.</p>

    subscriptions or creations of subsequent subscriptions. Details of usage, purchases, and other factors
    determine if a user qualifies for a refund when requested.</p>

<p>ALL REFUND REQUESTS are handled on a case-by-case basis. If you feel you are due a refund, contact MediaFire
    by email at refund@mediafire.com.</p>

<p><strong>Authorized Resellers:</strong></p>

<p>MediaFire has an Authorized Reseller Program to provide users an alternate means of purchasing MediaFire
    Services. These Authorized Resellers are not employees of MediaFire and do not conclude any contracts on
    behalf of MediaFire. Users who purchase MediaFire Services through an Authorized Reseller are still bound by
    and subject to the MediaFire Agreement. A list of Authorized Resellers can be viewed at the
    <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/resellers/" target="_blank">Resellers</a> page. Users should NOT purchase
    MediaFire Services from any third party not listed as an Authorized Reseller on our website. MediaFire
    Services cannot be activated if purchased outside the scope of this program or from MediaFire itself.</p>

<p>The Authorized Resellers purchase MediaFire Services in increments available only to resellers and offer the
    MediaFire Services to users for purchase. The purchase transaction itself is a contractual relationship
    solely between their Authorized Reseller and the user who purchased MediaFire Services from them. MediaFire
    is not responsible for Authorized Reseller billing questions or concerns, therefore, PURCHASE AND BILLING
    QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE AUTHORIZED RESELLER. Services normally provided by MediaFire for
    MediaFire users, including, but not limited to, technical support, will still be provided by MediaFire
    Customer Support. Concerns or complaints about an Authorized Reseller should be reported to our support
    department.</p>

    affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or
    enforceability of such provision under other circumstances.</p>
